#This is the base httpd.conf file of bitname/apache:2.4 docker container, we just have added << Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" >> to the htdocs directory settings
# and Header set Cache-Control "no-cache"
# and FileETag Digest for stable Etags accross loadbalanced servers for mounted files.
#   "FileETag Digest" is acceptable here because we have only small files on this server so
#   having to read the full content of the file instead of just the filesystem
#   metadata is not prohibitedly expensive. A better alternative would be to find
#   a way to have stable filesystem metadata on all servers because:
#   - accessing file system metadata is a lot less expensive.
#   - contrary to apache httpd, nginx doesn't have an option to change the ETag
#     generation method and always uses the filesystem metadata (size, mtime),
#     so using "FileEtag Digest" locks us in with apache httpd.
#   NOTE: this doesn't apply to files in the image (their filesystem metadata
#   is the same because it's from the image), only to mounted files (bind mount
#   or volume mount in docker compose, configmap in kubernetes)
#   NOTE: "FileEtag Digest" is not currently useful for our dev docker-compose
#     deployment but it doesn't hurt so set it. It's not useful because in docker
#     compose on a single host, the mounted files have the same filesystem
#     metadata (e.g. inode, mtime) as the files on the host (both when mounted as
#     files or when the parent dir is mounted, even accross multiple compose
#     replicas) so ETags are already stable. Stable ETags (using "FileEtag
#     Digest" or a better alternative) would become necessary if someone wanted to
#     deploy this compose project on multiple hosts (e.g. using docker swarm or
#     by manually running multiple docker compose commands and loadbalancing)
#   NOTE2: Because we use single file bind mounts for our files, the contents
#   and filesystem metadata of our files fall out of sync between the host and
#   the containers when the file is deleted or replaced (more precisely, as
#   soon as the inode number of the file changes) (this can happen quite silently
#   if your editor replaces the file when saving), but this means using Digest doesn't
#   solve this issue. This is a known docker limitation: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6011
