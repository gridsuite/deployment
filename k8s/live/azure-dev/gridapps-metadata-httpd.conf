# This is the base httpd.conf file of httpd:2.4 docker container, we just have added << Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" >> to the htdocs directory settings
# and the content-type application/json to the openid-configuration file
# and Header set Cache-Control "no-cache"
# and FileETag Digest for stable Etags accross loadbalanced servers for mounted files.
#   "FileETag Digest" is acceptable here because we have only small files on this server so
#   having to read the full content of the file instead of just the filesystem
#   metadata is not prohibitedly expensive. A better alternative would be to find
#   a way to have stable filesystem metadata on all servers because:
#   - accessing file system metadata is a lot less expensive.
#   - contrary to apache httpd, nginx doesn't have an option to change the ETag
#     generation method and always uses the filesystem metadata (size, mtime),
#     so using "FileEtag Digest" locks us in with apache httpd.
#   NOTE: this doesn't apply to files in the image (their filesystem metadata
#   is the same because it's from the image), only to mounted files (bind mount
#   or volume mount in docker compose, configmap in kubernetes)
